/* Analytics case: Yammer

Yammer is a social network for communicating with coworkers. Individuals share
documents, updates, and ideas by posting them in groups. Yammer is free to use
indefinitely, but companies must pay license fees if they want access to
administrative controls, including integration with user management systems 
like ActiveDirectory.

Yammer analysts are trained to constantly consider the value of each individual 
project; they seek to maximize the return on their time. Analysts typically opt 
for less precise solutions to problems if it means investing substantially less 
time as well. */
